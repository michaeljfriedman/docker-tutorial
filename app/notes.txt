Big picture
- Docker Compose + YAML config

  - docker container + Dockerfile
    - database

  - docker container + Dockerfile
    - app

------------------------------------

Notes

Docker container
- An isolated environment, which runs a single process with its own file system and IP address
- Simulates a separate machine without needing the whole OS underneath. So multiple containers can run on the same machine
- Comms between containers happens over local network
- A process can be:
  - A web server
  - A database server
  - ...

Docker also provides
- Volumes. A shared file system mounted by multiple containers. Used to share files
- Networks. A local network you can add containers to, so they can comm with each other

In this way, you isolate each of the components of your app:
- The running process
- Shared files
- Shared database

And any of these components can be local or remote. Easy to swap out local database for remote one in the cloud, since they all comm over a network anyway
